1 - When creating a new presentation, add a button to actually create the 
	presentation.
2 - When creating a new presentation, set focus on the title and style so that 
	it's obvious the user should edit that.
3 - New iteration of the API (keep backward compatibility)
	- separate api url pattern from browser's one using /api/
4 - The server should be able to serve pre-rendered files.
5 - Add a ?next=/url/ functionnality in case the user is not connected when 
	landing on a restricted mode.
6 - Add an abstraction layer on the client. We should have something like a
	PresentationProvider and SlideProvider, that take care of serving content
	whether from the server if we are online or from localstorage if offline.
